<pre><code>
  $ npm install -g  p-paper
  $ p-paper create          // Start a new paper on your machine
  $ p-paer  show            // View your paper locally
  $ p-paper publish draft   // Push a version of your paper to github and github pages to share with colaborators and friends
  $ p-paper publish release // Publish a version of your paper on github, assign it a DOI, register it on the paper-repository and submit it for peer-review.
  $ p-paper hard-copy       // Generate a pdf of your paper.

  <a id="what_is_this" class="anchor" href="#what_is_this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is p-paper</h3>



<p>From one year to the next science advances our understanding of the universe. Experiments, theories and results are published to deseminate this knowledge to the wider comunity.
  Inreasingly this process lives on the web which has increased the access to and speed with which these advances can be diseminated. Unfortunetly the format that typically used, PDF's are
  one that is still bogged down in the physical world. We navigate browsers to PDF documents and either download them or read them in a browser plugin.
</p>

<p>We think there is a better solution: create a new system for publishing papers that fully embraces the web. Papers are written using as set of custom, extensiable HTML elements which will
  allow embeding of data, interactive plots and inreased linking of content and rich API's to query and build tools on top of the litrature. Papers are published using a command line tool to
  github pages

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paper Componets</h3>

<p>Write a paper seamlesly using an evergrowing library of custom HTML elements. Create dynamic datasets, plots and equations. Link to versioned external datasets and
 retain a cononical version of your plots for printing and inital display. </p>

<p>P-paper uses the emerging web-components standard and specifically the Polymer library of polyfills and syntax to define paper specific tags. By composing theses together reseach can be
writen up quicker and easer than traditonal latex and take advantage of features like dynmic plots and linked equations and datasets.</p>

    <p-title>Freeze Rays and their applications</p-title>

    <p-abstract>
        Freeze rays hold the potential to change society for the better. We describe a trail run of this technology conducted at the Superhero memorial bridge.
        We conclude that this technology is currently not ready for production use and futher that there is strong correlation between beatings and announcing
        experimental procedure before the conducting of freeze ray experiments.

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Publishing</h3>

<p>Once you have your Nobel Prize winning paper you want to get it validated by other scientists and make it accessable to the wider world. While papers can be publised on any webserving platform we recomend
and encourage you to publish your paper using git hub and gh-pages. This way papers can be given a DOI and can be versioned and retained for archiving.</p>

<p>When you publish your paper three things will happen

  <ul>
    <li>Your paper will be uploaded to git hub and a release will be generated on git hub</li>
    <li>The p-paper server will fork a copy of your repo to retain for posperity. It will also parse the structure of your paper to add it to the paper directory, making your work discoverable and queriable by
      the comunity</li>
    <li>If you wish and specify so the p-paper server will start a process of peer review on your paper that will ultimetly end up it receving a validated publication status</li>
  </ul>
